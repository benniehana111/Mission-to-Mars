# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview

This analysis involved creating an automated web scraping process using Python, BeautifulSoup4, Splinter, Flask, Bootstrap, and MongoDB. The resulting Python files were used to scrape images and text from several NASA websites, then to populate a webpage with the scraping output. This webpage includes a button to automatically update the page with new information.  

## Results
